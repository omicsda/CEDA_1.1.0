\title{Generating the null distribution of the significance score 
of a gene.}
\usage{
makeRhoNull(n, p, nperm)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer representing sgRNA number of a gene.}

\item{p}{A numeric vector which contains the percentiles of the 
p-values that meet the cut-off (alpha).}

\item{nperm}{Number of permutation runs.}
}
\value{
A numric vector which contains all the significance scores 
  (rho) of genes generated by a permutation test where the sgRNAs are 
  randomly assigned to genes.
