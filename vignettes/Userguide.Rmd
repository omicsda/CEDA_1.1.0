# Introduction
We developed CEDA to analyze read counts of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs)
raw CRISPR screening experiments. The sgRNAs are synthetically generated from genes, 
and each gene can generate multiple sgRNAs. CEDA models the sgRNA counts at 
different levels of gene expression by multi-component normal mixtures, with the
model fit by an EM algorithm. Posterior estimates at sgRNA level are then summarized 
for each gene.

In this document, we use data from an experiment with the MDA231 cell line to illustrate
how to use CEDA to perform CRISPR screen data analysis.

# Overview
CEDA analysis follows a workflow that is typical for most omics level experiments.

1. Put the data into an appropriate format for input to CEDA.
2. Normalize the raw counts.
3. Fit a linear model to the data.
4. Summarize and view the results. 

## Data Format
In our experiment, three samples of MDA231 cells were untreated at time T=0,
and another three samples of MDA231 cells were treated with DMSO at time T=0.
We are interested in detecting sgRNAs that are differentially changed by a treatment. 

The sgRNA read counts, along with a list of non-essential genes, are stored 
in the dataset `mda231` that we have included in the `CEDA` package. We read that
dataset and explore its structure.
```{r data}
library(CEDA)
data("mda231")
class(mda231)
length(mda231)
names(mda231)
```
As you can see, this is a list containing two components

1. `sgRNA`, the observed count data of six samples, and
2. `neGene`, the set of non-essential genes.

```{r sgRNA}
dim(mda231$sgRNA)
length(mda231$neGene$Gene)
head(mda231$sgRNA)
```
Notice that the `sgRNA` component includes an extra column, "`exp.level.log2`", that
are the expression level (in log2 scale) of genes and was computed from raw gene 
expression data.
```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
UN <- apply((mda231$sgRNA[, 6:8]), 1, mean)
TR <- apply(log2(mda231$sgRNA[, 3:8]), 1, mean)
foo <- TR/UN
```

The second element of the list `neGene` is, as expected, just a list of gene names
that are the non-essential genes:
```{r neGene}
dim(mda231$neGene)
head(mda231$neGene)
```

## Normalization
The sgRNA read counts needs to be normalized across sample replicates before 
formal analysis. The non-essential genes are assumed to have no change after 
DMSO treatment. So, our recommended procedure is to perform median normalization
based on the set of non-essential genes.
```{r normalization}
mda231.ne <- mda231$sgRNA[mda231$sgRNA$Gene %in% mda231$neGene$Gene,]
cols <- c(3:8)
mda231.norm <- medianNormalization(mda231$sgRNA[,cols], mda231.ne[,cols])[[2]]
```

## Analysis
Our primary goal is to detect essential sgRNAs that have different count levels 
between conditions. We rely on the R package `limma` to calculate log fold ratios
between three untreated and three treated samples. 

### Calculating fold ratios
First, we have to go through the usual `limma` steps to describe the design of
the study. There were two groups of replicate samples. We will call these groups
"Control" and "Baseline" (although "Treated" and Untreated" would work just as well).
Our main interest is determining the differences between the groups. And we have to
record this information in a "contrast matrix" so limma knows what we want to compare.
```{r design}
group <- gl(2, 3, labels=c("Control","Baseline"))
design <- model.matrix(~  0 + group)
colnames(design) <- sapply(colnames(design), function(x) substr(x, 6, nchar(x)))
contrast.matrix <- makeContrasts("Control-Baseline", levels=design)
```
Finally, we can run the lmima algorithm.
```{r limfit}
limma.fit <- runLimma(log2(mda231.norm+1),design,contrast.matrix)
```

We merge the results from our limma analysis with the original sgRNA count data.
```{r merge}
mda231.limma <- data.frame(mda231$sgRNA, limma.fit)
head(mda231.limma)
```

### Fold ratios under the null hypotheses
Under the null hypothses, all sgRNAs levels are unchanged between the
two conditions. To obtain fold ratios under the null, samples were 
permuted between two conditions, and log fold ratios were obtained from
limma analysis under each permutation.
```{r betanull}
betanull <- permuteLimma(log2(mda231.norm + 1), design, contrast.matrix, 20)
theta0 <- sd(betanull)
theta0
```

### Fitting three-component mixture models
A three-component mixture model (unchanged, overexpresssed, and underexpressed)
is assumed for log fold ratios at 
different level of gene expression. Empirical Bayes method was employed 
to estimate parematers of the mixtures and posterior means were obtained 
for estimating actual log fold ratios between the two conditions. 
P-values of sgRNAs were then calculated by permutation method.

```{r mm, results='hide'}
nmm.fit <- normalMM(mda231.limma, theta0)
```

Results from the mixture model were shown in Figure $1$. False 
discovery rate of $0.05$ was used for declaring significant changes in red
color between the two conditions for sgRNAs.

```{r fig1, fig.cap = "Log fold ratios of sgRNAs vs. gene expression level"}
scatterPlot(nmm.fit$data,fdr=0.05,xlim=c(-0.5,12),ylim=c(-8,5))
```

### Gene level summarization
From the p-values of sgRNAs, gene level p-values were obtained by 
using modified robust rank aggregation method (alpha-RRA). Log 
fold ratios were also summarized at gene level.
```{r pval}
mda231.nmm <- nmm.fit[[1]]
p.gene <- calculateGenePval(exp(mda231.nmm$log_p), mda231.nmm$Gene, 0.05)
fdr.gene <- stats::p.adjust(p.gene$pvalue, method = "fdr")
lfc.gene <- calculateGeneLFC(mda231.nmm$lfc, mda231.nmm$Gene)
```
